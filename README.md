# OpenAI gym CartPole-v0 using keras with TensorFlow backend

Keras is an open source neural network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of MXNet, Deeplearning4j, Tensorflow, CNTK or Theano.

# Prerequisites

Python3.2 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
keras (https://keras.io/)
tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)


# Keras uses the following dependencies:

- numpy, scipy
- yaml
- HDF5 and h5py (optional, required if you use model saving/loading functions)
  Optional but recommended if you use CNNs: cuDNN.
